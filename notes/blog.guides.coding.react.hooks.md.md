# (WIP) Notes

- It seems like hooks are refactored logic that contains states and other React
  specific parts inside. The nice part is that states are isolated inside. I
  imagine this would be useful if you see that you have similar states in
  multiple functions that are being manipulated in the same way; you could
  refactor them into hooks.
