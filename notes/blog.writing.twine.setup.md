# Setup

I will be following
[Emilia's tutorial](https://dev.to/lazerwalker/a-modern-developer-s-workflow-for-twine-4imp)
on how to set up the Twine workflow. I will likely add some modifications as
well.

# Assumptions

- You already have git installed and know how to use git.

# Rough steps

- Download the Tweego CLI binary file.
- Set up a git repo.
- Make a basic story.
- Get the resulting html, hopefully named as `index.html`.
- Setup the CI/CD so that your game is automatically published.
- Iterate the story from there.
